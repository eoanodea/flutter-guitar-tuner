# ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Tuning App

## Description

Mostly is an app I made to show my roommate how awful her singing is, but it turns out it actually works as a clunky guitar tuning app.

Built using Flutter and utilises several pitch detection libraries to identify the pitch frequency in hertz, find the closest note and display the difference to the user. User friendly messages are displayed to the user like "Too low" or "Just awful".
